					<h3><a href="post1.html">Introduction</a></h3>
					<p>This creative project wasn't the easiest thing for me to come up with something for. At first, I wanted to create a website due to having taken 3 years of web development in high school and majoring in Computer Science. However, when I actually began looking into it, I was finding it hard to relate anything to modern adaptations, so I ended up choosing to create a blog for one of the characters. Once I began looking into websites that could be used to create this blog, I realized that I didn't like the free options and I was not going to pay for a membership to one of the services. In the end, I decided to just combine the prompts for creating a website and creating a blog. I created a new website from the ground up just to be able to have something that I thought looked nice and worked as a platform for me to write the blog on.<br><br>
					When brainstorming for a character to write the blog about, Medea came to mind. I imagine that Medea would have kept some sort of logs or journal relating to her days leading up to enacting her plan. Medea's thought process and desire to make Jason's world crumble around him made me believe that she would be the perfect candidate to run a blog.<br><br>
					When it came to writing the blog, I knew it would've been something that wasn't public knowledge, at least not until after her plan had already been enacted, so Medea just lets loose and says anything she wants to without having to worry about repercussions from people finding out. In the event that someone did find out, Medea wouldn't have cared for someone else's opinion, so for this reason all posts have comments disabled.</p>

					<h3><a href="post6.html">Time To Escape</a></h3>
					<p>I have just killed my children, the last hope Jason had left. Now it is time to escape. I will set off for Athens, the home of Aigeus, in a dragon-drawn chariot sent by my grandfather Helios.</p>
					<br><br><br>

					<h3><a href="post5.html">The Bride's Demise</a></h3>
					<p>I have just sent my children to go to the bride bearing gifts, requesting to be accepted and allowed to stay in the city with their father. A finely woven dress and a tiara of beaten gold, which I have smeared with poisons. When she takes the gifts, they will cause her and anyone who touches her to die a horrible death.<br><br>
					<b>EDIT: </b>I have just received word that the bride accepted the gifts, causing both her and King Creon to die horrible deaths.</p>
					<br><br><br>

					<h3><a href="post4.html">Escape Plan</a></h3>
					<p>How will I escape after the deed is done? I met with Aigeus, the King of Athens, today. I have begged him to allow me to stay in his country and protect me from anyone who might try to come after me for the acts of treason I am going to commit against the royal family. After a while, he swore an oath to do just that.</p>
					<br><br><br>

					<h3><a href="post3.html">On The Path Of Revenge</a></h3>
					<p>Since I am being exiled, what am I left to do but plan my attack? I do not intend to go willingly, but instead to wreak havoc on my way out. With the time left, I will kill the three devils who have wronged me. If I am unable to come up with a good enough plan in time, I will go murder them myself, even if it means I must die in the process.</p>
					<br><br><br>

					<h3><a href="post2.html">On The Path Of Exile</a></h3>
					<p>Today I, along with my children, was exiled from Corinth after having a conversation with King Creon. He said he was afraid of me, that I would do some irreparable harm to his daughter. Apparently there are rumors I am making threats against the royal family and my husband. I managed to convince him to let me stay for one more day to make plans for how we will survive once outside the city walls.</p>
					<br><br><br>

					<h3><a href="post1.html">A Message To The Gods</a></h3>
					<p>Jason, my husband, is the vilest man alive. He has betrayed myself and his children, his family. I have received news that he is to be married to the daughter of King Creon. I now pray to the gods asking to make my husband, King Creon and his daughter pay for their abuse towards me.</p>

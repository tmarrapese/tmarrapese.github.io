					<h3>Introduction</h3>
					<p>This creative project wasn't the easiest thing for me to come up with something for. At first, I wanted to create a website due to having taken 3 years of web development in high school and majoring in Computer Science. However, when I actually began looking into it, I was finding it hard to relate anything to modern adaptations, so I ended up choosing to create a blog for one of the characters. Once I began looking into websites that could be used to create this blog, I realized that I didn't like the free options and I was not going to pay for a membership to one of the services. In the end, I decided to just combine the prompts for creating a website and creating a blog. I created a new website from the ground up just to be able to have something that I thought looked nice and worked as a platform for me to write the blog on.<br><br>
					When brainstorming for a character to write the blog about, Medea came to mind. I imagine that Medea would have kept some sort of logs or journal relating to her days leading up to enacting her plan. Medea's thought process and desire to make Jason's world crumble around him made me believe that she would be the perfect candidate to run a blog.<br><br>
					When it came to writing the blog, I knew it would've been something that wasn't public knowledge, so Medea just lets loose and says anything she wants to without having to worry about repercussions from people finding out. In the event that someone did find out, Medea wouldn't have cared for someone else's opinion, so for this reason all posts have comments disabled.</p>
